- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Kat, Ayano

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended Jordan's office hours on Friday 02.09

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The syntax in Java feels more verbose compared to Python, especially with the use of semicolons and curly braces. However, the strict syntax rules in Java also help enforce clarity and readability. Unlike Python, Java is statically typed, which means I had to declare variable types explicitly. This added an extra step in programming but also provided more clarity about variable types and reduced runtime errors.


- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
While Python excels in simplicity and flexibility, Java emphasizes performance, type safety, and platform independence. So, the choice of language depends on the specific requirements of the project, the target platform, and the preferences of the development team.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
While working on this assignment, I ran into several problems as I didn;t initially desgin the code in my head/paper and didn't go through logistics, even though I was warned multiple times. The original code did not provide a varied response when the user's input did not contain any pronouns. I added logic to generate a random response from a predefined set of canned responses when no pronouns were found in the user's input. Actually drawing the design for the code on paper helped me
